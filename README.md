## 💡 Inspiration

What if pigeons could do more than just poop on statues? We thought, "Hey, why not make them deliver messages and packages instead?" So, we built PigeonAir—taking flight with an old-school meme.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

We took the idea of pigeons delivering messages and made it modern—kinda like Uber, but for pigeons. Our platform uses local storage for saving messages and packages, while our virtual pigeons do the rest!

## 🏆 Accomplishments

We managed to turn memes into a business model! And yes, the pigeons do their job (mostly) well. Plus, we've got a pop feature that makes everyone giggle.

## 📚 What We Learned

Memes + delivery services = the future. Also, pigeons are surprisingly good at flying (except when they get distracted). We also learned how to handle unexpected pops and maintain our sanity.

## 🔮 What's Next for PigeonAir

We're looking to expand our pigeon fleet, introduce more "pop" levels (think "super mega pop"), and maybe even bring in real pigeons... if they don't mind working with a computer.
